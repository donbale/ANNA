  - A digital reflection is the combination of several Deep Learning Models which reflect a users voice and conversational tone. It is not you but it sounds like you.

  - Training takes place over several stages. When you start a stage you agree that your responses are saved to our secure servers. Your responses are then used to train the next stage of your reflection model. The voice part of this data is used to fine tune a deep learning text to speech model which will be used in your reflection.

* faq/voice_when_can_hear
  - Voice models improve over time, although is possible to create a rudimentary model early on dependent on the length of your given responses. The quality of your reflected voice does depend on the quality of the recordings we receive in your responses. It is always advised to test your audio and to record in a quiet environment speaking directly into your devices microphone.

  - Training takes place over several stages. When you start a stage you agree that your responses are saved to our secure servers. Your responses are then used to train the next stage of your reflection model. The written part of this data is used to fine tune a deep learning conversational response model which will be used in your reflection.

* faq/personality_questions
  - The questions asked during the training stages have been specially selected to get a true reflection of you. However they are just the questions, it is your responses that count. The most complete and truthful responses will result in more accurate conversational response models. The more stages you complete the clearer the reflection.
